# CTNG

The CTNG is a software module that allows a computer to interact with a PABX using an interface based on CSTA. The software module is not a complete application that can be used directly, but is rather a means for writing customized applications. The CTNG consists of routines for managing CSTA objects, and performing services based on the CSTA Phase I standard.

The project documentation is in `doc` folder.
